# Unified-Dynamic-Annotation-Generator

UDAG is designed to enable different disciplines
to display their automatic pre-processing results
in a schema-based and reproducible,
dynamic and interactive way without the need to
hard-code manual and user-defined visualizations
for each new project. It is highly configurable and allows data
filtering at different levels. UDAG provides a set of interactive visualization components,
such as text highlighting, networks, and different
chart types, that can be arranged by the user in
a dashboard-like grid. Charts can also depend
on one another, for example to share the same
topic-related colors. Built with Java, Spring, and
Freemarker, UDAG aims to reduce the time and
effort involved in creating visualizations for multilevel annotation data by reducing complexity and
enabling reuse, while still giving users full control
over how their data is presented.

## Features

- **Multi-Corpus-based**: Supports multiple corpora across languages and types with consistent compatibility and corpus-level filtering.
- **Modification-based**: Enables modification of existing visualizations, templates, and data mappings for dynamic annotations.
- **Schema-based**: Uses an extensible annotation schema to ensure flexible, reusable, and multimodal visualization.
- **Extension-based**: Allows easy expansion or modification of visualization components and their generators.
- **Multimodal-based**: Supports visualization and interaction with multimodal data such as text, audio, and video.
- **API-based**: Provides API access for retrieving, processing, and presenting annotation data efficiently.
- **Web-based**: Ensures web-based, responsive, and mobile-friendly access to dynamic visualizations.
- **Filter-based**: Enables real-time filtering and prioritization of annotations for dynamic visualization.
